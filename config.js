            description: 'Mapping Colombian Emblematic Memories is an ongoing digital humanities project producing a visual representation of the linkage between popular and influential depictions of the past and place. The emblematic memories the project is mapping are related to the legacies, traumas, and embodied interpretations of the Colombian violence. The map contains a growing amount of sites of memory different social movements and institutions of the state are putting in place. Those physical places have been starting to be enunciated by different stakeholders as more extensive networks we will call infrastructures of remembrance. Mapping Colombian Emblematic Memories is not a project seeking to provide a harmonic picture of the past. The project point at the struggles for recognition various and sometimes conflicting groups are giving against different forms of oblivion, something the project calls politics of memory. Hopefully, mapping the plurality of emblematic memories about the past in Colombia will produce meaningful discussions and solidarities to find alternatives to the Colombian specters of violence and exclusion.',

            description: 'The historian Steve Stern came up with the "emblematic memory" concept while studying the Chilean public debate over the meaning of Allende´s Government and Pinochet´s dictatorship. He proposed three archetypical figures to depict the contentious emblematic memories circulating and clashing in the semipublic and public spheres: heroic memory, dissident memory, and indifferent memory.   Those archetypes, in Stern´s writing, are deeply contextual. In other words, they only speak of the "Chilean historical experience." However, two of them (heroic and dissident) resonate with what we could call Colombian emblematic memories, which we are discussing later. ',

            description: 'Emblematic memory is a valuable concept to study socially significant memories. The concept seeks to represent a framework organizing the meaning and the selectivity of a complex assemblage of individual remembrances, values, and experiences. Unlike personal memory, the emblematic memory circulates in public and semipublic spheres, nailing together in a somewhat coherent web of meaning personal stories and experiences. It is also safe to say emblematic memories have a hegemonic impulse seeking to contest rival depictions of the past by arguing the possession of truth. The Museum of Memory and Human Rigths you are looking at, is an interesting site to ask questions like what memories get to be represented, or how influent they are outside of the curated walls of the musuem.

Anthropologist Jonah Rubin in his study of the "memory movement" in Spain, introduces two beneficial concepts for the purposes of this project: politics of memory and infrastructures of memory. According to him, the Politics of memory is a struggle to gain recognition from the state for violence perpetrated against marginalized groups. However, it is essential to remember the definition of what constitutes a marginalized group is up for debate, controversy, and constant redefinition. Social movement scholars like Charles Tilly, Sidney Tarrow, or Paul Almeida, remind us every social group can define grievances, and therefore a sense of marginalization concerning other groups.',

The Valley of the Fallen, the biggest and probably the most controversial monument of the civil war in Spain, is one of the most visible and critical nodes of the infrastructure of memory in Spain.
